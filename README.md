# amplifier-bundle-harness-machine

Generate constraint harnesses for LLM agents — from tiny nano-amplifiers to enterprise-scale governance systems. Built on the AutoHarness paper (Lou et al., Google DeepMind, 2026), this bundle provides a seven-mode interactive pipeline and four automation recipes for systematically designing, generating, critiquing, refining, and evaluating constraint harnesses. Whether you're constraining a game-playing agent's action space or building a factory that generates harnesses for dozens of environments, harness-machine gives you the structure to do it rigorously and repeatably.

## Seven-Mode Pipeline

```
  /harness-explore ──► /harness-spec ──► /harness-plan ──► /harness-execute
        │                                                         │
        │                                                         ▼
        │                                                  /harness-verify
        │                                                    │         │
        │                                                    ▼         ▼
        └──────────────────────── /harness-debug ◄── fail  pass ──► /harness-finish
```

Each mode has a focused role: **explore** maps the environment, **spec** designs the harness, **plan** chooses single vs. factory, **execute** runs the generator/critic/refiner pipeline, **verify** measures legal action rate, **finish** packages and delivers, **debug** handles failures at any stage.

## Two-Track UX

| Track | How | Best For |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Interactive modes** | `/harness-explore` → `/harness-spec` → `/harness-plan` → `/harness-execute` → `/harness-verify` → `/harness-finish` | Hands-on sessions where you want control and visibility at each step |
| **Factory automation** | `harness-development-cycle.yaml` or `harness-factory-generation.yaml` | End-to-end automation with approval gates; batch generation across environments |

Both tracks produce the same artifact: a constraint harness packaged as a nano-amplifier. Modes give you the steering wheel; recipes give you cruise control.

## Quick Start — Interactive Track

```
# Step 1: Enter explore mode and describe your target environment
/harness-explore

# Step 2: After feasibility assessment, design the harness spec
/harness-spec

# Step 3: Plan implementation (single harness or factory)
/harness-plan

# Step 4: Run the generator → critic → refiner pipeline
/harness-execute

# Step 5: Measure legal action rate and reward
/harness-verify

# Step 6: Package and deliver (merge, PR, or keep)
/harness-finish

# At any point: diagnose constraint failures or convergence plateaus
/harness-debug
```

## Quick Start — Factory Track

```python
# Run end-to-end with approval gates between stages
recipes.execute(
    recipe_path="harness-machine:recipes/harness-development-cycle.yaml",
    context={
        "project_name": "my-agent",
        "environment_description": "TextArena chess game",
        "target_legal_action_rate": 0.95,
    }
)

# Batch generation across multiple environments
recipes.execute(
    recipe_path="harness-machine:recipes/harness-factory-generation.yaml",
    context={
        "project_name": "game-agents",
        "environments": ["chess", "poker", "go"],
    }
)
```

## Artifact Format

Harness artifacts are delivered in three tiers based on scope:

| Tier | Format | Contents | When to Use |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Nano** | `.amplifier/` directory | `behavior.yaml`, `constraints.py`, `context.md` | Single environment, single agent |
| **Bundle** | Amplifier bundle | `bundle.md`, `behaviors/`, `modules/` | Reusable harness across projects |
| **Machine** | `.harness-machine/` directory | `STATE.yaml`, recipes, Docker infrastructure | Factory: multiple environments, autonomous loop |

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose | Next Step |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `/harness-explore` | Understand environment, map action space, assess feasibility | `/harness-spec` |
| `/harness-spec` | Design harness specification (type, scale, constraints, criteria) | `/harness-plan` |
| `/harness-plan` | Plan implementation: single harness or factory machine | `/harness-execute` |
| `/harness-execute` | Orchestrate generator → critic → refiner pipeline | `/harness-verify` |
| `/harness-verify` | Evidence-based verification: legal action rate, reward measurement | `/harness-finish` or `/harness-debug` |
| `/harness-finish` | Package and deliver: nano-amplifier, bundle, or factory | Session complete |
| `/harness-debug` | Diagnose constraint failures, convergence plateaus, search errors | `/harness-verify` |

## Decision Architecture: Pico vs Nano vs Micro

The three tiers represent fundamentally different decision-making architectures:

| Tier | Decision Model | Key Capability | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pico** | Single-loop reactor | Constraint enforcement + basic tools | 800-1,500 |
| **Nano** | Multi-source reasoner with memory | + streaming, sessions, dynamic context, multi-provider | 2,000-3,500 |
| **Micro** | Orchestrating multi-agent system | + modes, recipes, delegation, approval gates, intent detection | 5,000-8,000 |

**The progression: reactive (pico) → aware (nano) → orchestrating (micro).**

Each tier adds a new dimension of agency, not just more tools. The constraint engine (the safety layer) remains identical across all tiers.

For the full comparison with decision flowcharts, capability matrices, and real-world examples, see **[Decision Architecture Guide](docs/DECISION-ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Research Foundation

This bundle implements the constraint harness methodology from **AutoHarness: Automated Harness Synthesis Using LLMs** (Lou et al., Google DeepMind, 2026, arXiv:2603.03329). The paper introduces a generate/critique/refine loop for synthesizing `is_legal_action()` and `propose_action()` functions, Thompson sampling for convergence, and a three-tier harness architecture (nano-amplifier → harness bundle → harness machine). The AutoHarness framework achieves high legal action rates across diverse environments by treating constraint generation as an iterative refinement problem with measurable acceptance criteria rather than a one-shot synthesis task.
